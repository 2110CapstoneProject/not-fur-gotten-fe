## ABSTRACT (WHAT, HOW, WHY)
Welcome to Not Furgotten! This is an application that partners individuals who are no longer able to care for their pets with people who would like to adopt them. 
- INCLUDE PLENTY OF GIFS OF WORKING PROJ

## FUTURE FEATURES
In the future, we would want to:
- Add a delete feature to the applications page
- When a re-homer chooses which application they want to follow through on, and then chooses the new owner/home, an administrative feature which removes the newly re-homed pet from the list of pets available for adoption. 
- Having a login feature, one for the re-homer, and then one for the user who wants to adopt a pet.
