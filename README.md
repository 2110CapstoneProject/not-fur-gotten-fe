## OVERVIEW
Not Furgotten is a Capstone project at the Turing School of Software and Design that was built with `create-react-app` and tested using `Cypress`. This Capstone Project allowed students from the Frontend Program to work with students from the Backend Program.  Together we seemlessly learned a stretch technology - `GraphQL` and `Apollo Client`.  On this website, a user can put their beloved pet up for adoption by filling out a form telling a little about themselves and their loveable pet. They can also upload an image of their pet to be displayed on the adoption page.  A user who is looking to adopt a pet will be directed to the home page where they can browse all the pets that are up for adoption.  Once they select one, they can read all the pet information shared by the owner and if they desire, they can also choose to read about the pet's current owner. Once they have selected a pet they would like to adopt, a user will be directed to an application form to tell about themselves.  The current owner is able to see all the applications of people interested in adopting their pet.

## FUTURE FEATURES
In the future, we would want to:
- Having a login feature, one for the re-homer, and then one for the user who wants to adopt a pet.
- Add a delete feature to the applications page.
- When a re-homer chooses which application they want to follow through on, and then chooses the new owner/home, an administrative feature which removes the newly re-homed pet from the list of pets available for adoption.
- Make the application mobile responsive.
